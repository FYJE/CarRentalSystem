# Car Rental System (C++)

A modular, object-oriented car rental management system built in C++. Designed for clarity, minimalism, and practical implementation of core programming concepts like linked lists, encapsulation, and file I/O.

## Features

- Add, delete, and update car records
- Register and manage customer profiles
- Rent and return cars with status tracking
- File-based persistence for cars and customers
- Modular class design across multiple .cpp and .h files

## Architecture

- Car.h / Car.cpp: Defines car attributes and operations
- Customer.h / Customer.cpp: Manages customer data
- Rental.h / Rental.cpp: Handles rental transactions
- Main.cpp: Entry point with menu-driven interface
- Additional utility files for validation and file handling

## How to Compile

g++ *.cpp -o CarRentalSystem  
./CarRentalSystem

Requires a C++11-compatible compiler

## File Format

- cars.txt: Stores car data (ID, model, status)
- customers.txt: Stores customer info (ID, name, license)
- rentals.txt: Tracks active and completed rentals

## Sample Usage

1. Add new car  
2. Register customer  
3. Rent car  
4. Return car  
5. View reports

## Design Philosophy

- Minimal gate count logic in class relationships  
- Separation of concerns across modules  
- Efficient use of pointers and dynamic memory  
- Clean mapping between real-world entities and code structure
